        <h3> What is depression?</h3>
        
       <p>Depression is a serious mental health disorder that can cause a person to have a deep emotional breakdown and it can also lead to end someone's life. People that are going through depression have a hard time reaching out for help. They feel unhappy, worthless, insecure, tired, or lonely. In society they have a stigma towards people with mental health issue, and many people believe they are weak. Depression is an illness that can destroy someone life, physically, mentally and emotionally. Not everyone that goes through depression survives, they end up committing suicide assuming it was their only answer to their life.
